                        Rafting and whitewater rafting are recreational outdoor activities which use an inflatable
                        raft
                        to
                        navigate a river or other body of water. This is often done on whitewater or different
                        degrees
                        of
                        rough
                        water. Dealing with risk is often a part of the experience.
