                Beautiful and fascinating Papua New Guinea. We can not wait to return to this wild and fascinating
                place! People make this trip so special.Papua New Guinea is one of the most linguistically diverse
                countries in the world. There are 851 known languages in the country, of which 11 now have no known
                speakers. As of 2019, it is also the most rural, as only 13.25% of its people live in urban centres.
                Most of the population of more than 8,000,000 people live in customary communities, which are as diverse
                as the languages. The country is one of the world's least explored, culturally and geographically.
                It is known to have numerous groups of uncontacted peoples, and researchers believe there are many
                undiscovered species of plants and animals in the interior.

                Rafting and whitewater rafting are recreational outdoor activities which use an inflatable raft to
                navigate a river or other body of water. This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough
                water. Dealing with risk is often a part of the experience.
