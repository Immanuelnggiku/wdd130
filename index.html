<p> The Indonesian archipelago has been a valuable region
     for trade since at least the 7th century when Srivijaya and
      later Majapahit traded with entities from mainland China 
      and the Indian subcontinent. Local rulers gradually absorbed 
      foreign influences from the early centuries, and Hindu and Buddhist
       kingdoms flourished. Sunni traders and Sufi scholars brought Islam,
        while Christianity was brought mostly through European explorers.         </p>
