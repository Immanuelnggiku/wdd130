        <p>Asian English Olympic is an annual English Olympiad which is claimed to be the biggest in Asia. This Olympiad
          is held by Bina Nusantara English Club, and is a series of other competitions beside debate; such as speech
          delivering competition, news-casting, short-movie making, and other competitions. AEO 2013 debate competition
          was unique because its debate format was adopting British Parliamentary system, where there were 4 fractions;
          each of it played a role as opening and closing government, as well as opening and closing opposition!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Victory was achieved by this team for their success in defeated and refuted the arguments from other debate
          teams representing opposition, and because of the team contribution was greater than the debate team who was
          represented closing government fraction. "It's such a proud to win this debate competition. I'm also happy to
          both meet and learn from international juries to expand the insight of debate world internationally," said
          Vicario.</p>
